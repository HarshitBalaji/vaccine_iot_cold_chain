More research on anomalies - Literature analysis of anomalies in IoT networks with those particular devices and this scenario

Define Anomaly and what is normal and deviation

Mathematical model of the algorithms used - the model and ML results match. Need to fit ML model incase they don't match.


CVSS Scoring - NIST 800 


Ensure the following:
1. The baselines are Isolation Forest and Risk Fusion models
2. The Proposed system is a multilayer anomaly detection system that detects both operational and cybersecurity anomalies. Operational anomalies include Temperature, Humidity, Geofence, Tamper and Cyber (cyber anomaly).
